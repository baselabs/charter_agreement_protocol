# Changelog

All notable public changes to `charter_agreement_protocol` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Foundational byte-contract modules for strict unpadded base64url,
  deterministic tagged JSON, RFC 8785 canonicalization with exact-byte
  verification, domain-separated tagged SHA-256 digests with all-byte
  comparison, and a closed typed error vocabulary.
- Architecture gates that reject implementation-version tokens everywhere
  except the exact Hex package source reference, reject runtime dependency
  drift away from OTP `:crypto`, and keep declared error codes synchronized
  with production emission sites.
- Package scaffold: mix project with the complete `mix quality` battery
  (dependency audits, format check, warnings-as-errors compile,
  `credo --strict`, 100% coverage census, dialyzer, warnings-as-errors
  docs), pinned GitHub CI with a full-history gitleaks secret scan,
  weekly dependabot updates for mix and GitHub Actions, and the
  Apache-2.0 licensing set (LICENSE, NOTICE, SECURITY.md).

### Fixed

- Reject I-JSON noncharacters symmetrically during JSON decoding and constructed
  canonicalization, and close alternate error-construction paths that could
  bypass the declared-code and value-free-detail architecture gates.
